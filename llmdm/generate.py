You are an AI language model tasked with generating JSON output containing an NPC's (Non-Player Character's) initial affinity information for a text-based RPG. The affinity the NPC has for the player is represented by two attributes:

1. **affinity_score**: An integer that determines the NPC's relationship status toward the player, based on the following scale:

- If `affinity_score <= -50`:
    - Status: **"Enemy"**
- If `-49 <= affinity_score <= -10`:
    - Status: **"Rival"**
- If `-9 <= affinity_score <= 9`:
    - Status: **"Neutral"**
- If `10 <= affinity_score <= 49`:
    - Status: **"Friendly"**
- If `50 <= affinity_score <= 89`:
    - Status: **"Ally"**
- If `90 <= affinity_score`:
    - Status: **"Loved One"**

2. **affinity_type**: A string indicating how the NPC's affinity for the player can change over time. The types are:

    - **"fixed"**: These NPCs have no capacity to shift their opinions or affinities through regular actions. They hold a consistent perspective, either due to an intrinsic personality trait (e.g., strong-willed, resolute) or because of past events that make them immovable.
    - **"dynamic"**: These NPCs are naturally adaptable and responsive, able to change their perspective more frequently. However, each change is slightly less intense, representing a slower but constant potential for influence. Dynamic NPCsâ€™ affinity scores might fluctuate with smaller events and interactions, allowing for more dynamic, story-driven responses.
    - **"deciding"**: These NPCs are initially open to influence but become gradually more resistant as their affinity changes. Each significant shift (e.g., from neutral to friendly, or friendly to ally) makes them less responsive to further changes.

**Output Format:**

Please generate the output in the following JSON format:
{
  "affinity_score": <integer>,
  "affinity_type": "<fixed|dynamic|deciding>"
}

**Instructions:**

- Ensure that the `affinity_score` is an integer within the appropriate range corresponding to one of the statuses.
- The `affinity_type` should be one of the specified types: "fixed", "dynamic", or "deciding".
- Do not include any additional text outside of the JSON structure.

The following is a description of the NPC:

A player has just had the following conversation with the NPC {npc.name}:
{conversation}

The NPC ({npc.name}) currently has an affinity score of {npc.affinity_score} with the player, which places them in the {npc.relationship_status} range. Consider the NPCâ€™s personality traits, relationship type, and recent interactions with the player.

Does this interaction:

    Increase the affinity that the NPC has for the player slightly, moderately, or significantly?
    Decrease the affinity that the NPC has for the player slightly, moderately, or significantly?
    Have no effect because itâ€™s repetitive or unimportant?

Remember the Output Requirements:
- Format: The output must be in JSON format. Do not output any other explaination other than the JSON.
- Fields:
    - `change`: The numerical change in affinity score (positive for increase, negative for decrease).
    - `reason`: A brief description explaining why this action caused the score change.
""",

You are assisting with a text-based RPG where players interact with NPCs (non-player characters). Each NPC has an affinity score toward the player, represented on a scale from -100 to 100. This affinity score reflects the NPCâ€™s relationship toward the player, which is influenced by the playerâ€™s actions and the NPCâ€™s personality.

Affinity Ranges:
- Enemy: -100 to -50
- Rival: -49 to -10
- Neutral: -9 to 9
- Friendly: 10 to 49
- Ally: 50 to 89
- Loved One: 90 to 100

Scoring Change Guide:
- Determine how much an action affects the affinity score, using these guidelines:
  - Slight Change: Â±1â€“3 points for minor actions or actions with little emotional impact.
  - Moderate Change: Â±4â€“7 points for actions of moderate significance.
  - Significant Change: Â±8â€“10 points for highly impactful actions or pivotal events in the relationship.
- Use negative values for actions that decrease affinity and positive values for actions that increase affinity.

Output Requirements:
- Format: The output must be in JSON format. Do not output any other explaination other than the JSON.
- Fields:
    - `change`: The numerical change in affinity score (positive for increase, negative for decrease).
    - `reason`: A brief description explaining why this action caused the score change.
